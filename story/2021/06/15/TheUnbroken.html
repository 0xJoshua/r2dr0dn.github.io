<p>There Was A Young Man In His Bright Days, He Lived Very Well Most Of His Childhood And His Teenage Years, He Loved The Human Nature And Had Interest In Studying Psychiatry On His Own.
     He Studied Hard And Began Understanding Of Human Behaviour, as well as started experimenting with different actions of what a normal being would do in many situations where their mood will affect their actions and so on. One day in school a pretty girl shows up in his class she was lovely and polite with blue eye, blonde hair all that a perfect girl would look like, he first didn’t take it much of interest but something off of his mind told him to make contact as of he looked at her in the eyes he got paralyzed and stopped thinking as something stung him inside, he introduced himself to her and had a small chat with her till the class was over, after he went home he forgot about what happened like its just another ordinary meet-up till the next day when he saw her again he didn’t bother talking to her not to be rude and just continued focusing on his stuff till she sits next to him, he didn’t flinch or even care but his classmates kept pushing him to talk to her so he finally did and it went great for him they laughed together and had fun.
    The young man one day stumbled upon her account and both began talking for hours every day, as time goes on they both liked each other it was extraordinary for the young man as he only kept thinking about her regularly. In school, they usually meet up either in breaks or after school everything was going perfectly for both of them as they passed the final exams in the same class and graduated. As of each one they spent the summer on different locations they always kept calling each other every single day it was so amusing he one day confessed to her about his feelings and it seems she was not surprised she liked it, he still remembers the day she confessed to him about her love to her first “I love you” when he was sitting alone talking on the phone with her they both were laughing and talking about romantic ideas and he asked her if she loves him, she wasn’t sure about telling not because she didn’t love him but just because she was sort of afraid but he pushed her a little and she happily told him, she even repeated it multiple times it was the best day in his entire life, I can ensure you he still has a vision of that exact moment it cannot be erased from his memory neither his heart.
    The rest of the summer was fabulous as they both shared romantic memories that last forever, they both planned for their future and what they will do in their lives together. When summer was finally over each one of them decided will continue their studies in different schools they weren’t that far, however as far as I know her classes schedule was empty in the afternoon so she usually visits him regularly like 4 to 5 times a week and she would wait for him until he comes out at that moment you realize how their love was. Small Actions make a big difference, they would spend 15 to 30 minutes together and he loved holding her hand it was like his treasure. She was his treasure and he could’ve done everything to keep it, he used to kiss her hand regularly because it was a way of showing love to her and she liked it and when he doesn’t do it she would get made for not holding her hands he immediately do it and they both laugh at each other.
    Their strong connection relied on both of them as they would face any obstacle comes in front of them with ease yet the devil needed to tear it up and tried to find multiple ways to break the chain, as one day the young man made the worst mistake in his life that made him suffer for years continuously. The young man knew what he has done and walked out as he refers to it as “The Walk Of Shame”, he was broken and couldn’t face her he felt he betrayed her and thought about suicide just to atonement for the mistakes he made, he knew he doesn’t deserve her since he let her down. However, with all this, she came to him and tried let things back to what it was before but the young man couldn’t just forgive himself since he lied to her and broke her trust. 
    The young made braced himself and took all pain with him in his journey that lasted 3 years, he tried forgetting about what happened but he couldn’t, he tried knowing new people which he did but he always felt unhappy and depressed around them as they didn’t offer the same stuff he used to get with her and he ends up most of the time blocking everyone out, he always randomly remembers every day his old memories that made the happiest man alive are now from the past, he wishes if he could come back and change what happened yet that’s not impossible, he keeps thinking and thinking which eventually made him a brain-dead walking man.
    The young man made it through a lot and faced the consequences till the final moments which most people would never consider and usually just give up, but he didn’t he stood up and fought his darkest fears he defeated life barriers and became what he calls it “Worthy Again”. He has done it with nothing but his self-esteem. The young man’s feelings for the girl remained a mystery and they were nowhere to be found, he kept them for himself for a long time and never shared them with anyone neither told anybody about his deeper secrets as he stated “Time and time again I have to pinch myself when I see you next to me. You are my dream come true.” he also stated, “It doesn’t matter if that person moved on with his or her life, fell for somebody else, even became a different person; <em>you will – always and forever – love that person</em>.”.
    It’s still unclear whether or not the young man achieved his true momentum, but as time passed by his destiny finally smiled back at him.</p>
